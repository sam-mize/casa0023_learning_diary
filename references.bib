  abstract = {The Sentinel-2 program provides the opportunity to monitor terrestrial ecosystems with a high temporal and spectral resolution. In this study, a multi-temporal Sentinel-2 data set was used to classify common tree species over a mature forest in central Sweden. The tree species to be classified were Norway spruce (Picea abies), Scots pine (Pinus silvestris), Hybrid larch (Larix \texttimes{} marschlinsii), Birch (Betula sp.) and Pedunculate oak (Quercus robur). Four Sentinel-2 images from spring (7 April and 27 May), summer (9 July) and fall (19 October) of 2017 were used along with the Random Forest (RF) classifier. A variable selection approach was implemented to find fewer and uncorrelated bands resulting in the best model for tree species identification. The final model resulting in the highest overall accuracy (88.2\%) came from using all bands from the four image dates. The single image that gave the most accurate classification result (80.5\%) was the late spring image (27 May); the 27 May image was always included in subsequent image combinations that gave the highest overall accuracy. The five tree species were classified with a user's accuracy ranging from 70.9\% to 95.6\%. Thirteen of the 40 bands were selected in a variable selection procedure and resulted in a model with only slightly lower accuracy (86.3\%) than that using all bands. Among the highest ranked bands were the red edge bands 2 and 3 as well as the narrow NIR (near-infrared) band 8a, all from the 27 May image, and SWIR (short-wave infrared) bands from all four image dates. This study shows that the red-edge bands and SWIR bands from Sentinel-2 are of importance, and confirms that spring and/or fall images capturing phenological differences between the species are most useful to tree species classification.},

  abstract = {Background The assessment of change in forest ecosystems, especially the change of canopy heights, is essential for improving global carbon estimates and understanding effects of climate change. Spaceborne lidar systems provide a unique opportunity to monitor changes in the vertical structure of forests. NASA's Ice, Cloud and Land Elevation Satellites, ICESat-1 for the period 2003 to 2009, and ICESat-2 (available since 2018), have collected elevation data over the Earth's surface with a time interval of 10 years. In this study, we tried to discover forest canopy changes by utilizing the global forest canopy height map of 2005 (complete global coverage with 1\,km resolution) derived from ICESat-1 data and the ATL08 land and vegetation products of 2019 (sampling footprints with 17\,m diameter) from ICESat-2. Results Our study revealed a significant increase in forest canopy heights of China's Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region. Evaluations of unchanging areas for data consistency of two products show that the bias values decreased significantly from line-transect-level (-\,8.0 to 6.2\,m) to site-level (-\,1.5 to 1.1\,m), while RMSE values are still relatively high (6.1 to 15.2\,m, 10.2 to 12.0\,m). Additionally, 58\% of ATL08 data are located in `0\,m' pixels with an average height of 7.9\,m, which are likely to reflect the ambitious tree planting programs in China. Conclusions Our study shows that it is possible, with proper calibrations, to use ICESat-1 and -2 products to detect forest canopy height changes in a regional context. We expect that the approach presented in this study is potentially suitable to derive a fine-scale map of global forest change.},
